# Next Steps for Migrating to Supabase

We've prepared everything you need to migrate your loyalty backend application from SQLite to Supabase PostgreSQL. Here's a summary of what we've done and what you need to do next.

## What We've Done

1. **Created migration tools and guides**:
   - `supabase_migration_guide.md` - Detailed migration instructions
   - `supabase_test.py` - Script to test Supabase connection
   - `data_migration.py` - Tool to migrate data from SQLite to PostgreSQL
   - `SUPABASE_README.md` - Quick overview and reference

2. **Modified database configuration files**:
   - Updated `app/database.py` to support both SQLite and Supabase
   - Updated `alembic.ini` and `alembic/env.py` to handle migrations

3. **Tested the application with SQLite**:
   - Successfully ran migrations with SQLite
   - Ensured the application works in its current state

## What You Need to Do

1. **Verify your Supabase connection details**:
   - Log in to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/)
   - Go to Project Settings > Database
   - Find the correct connection string
   - The hostname appears to be incorrect in your current connection string

2. **Test your connection**:
   - Update the connection parameters in `supabase_test.py`
   - Run the test script: `python supabase_test.py`
   - If there are any issues, follow the troubleshooting tips

3. **Update configuration files**:
   - In `app/database.py`: Uncomment and update the `SUPABASE_URL`
   - In `alembic.ini`: Update `sqlalchemy.url`
   - In `alembic/env.py`: Uncomment and update the Supabase URL

4. **Run database migrations**:
   - Execute: `alembic upgrade head`
   - This will create all required tables in your Supabase database

5. **Migrate your data** (if needed):
   - Update connection details in `data_migration.py`
   - Run: `python data_migration.py`
   - Check migration logs for any issues

6. **Test your application with Supabase**:
   - Run your application: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
   - Test all major features to ensure data is properly stored and retrieved

## Common Gotchas

1. **Network restrictions**: Supabase may have IP restrictions that prevent your connection
2. **Data type differences**: PostgreSQL enforces data types more strictly than SQLite
3. **Password in URL**: Make sure the password is properly URL-encoded
4. **Performance**: Remote database connections introduce latency
